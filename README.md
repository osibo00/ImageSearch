# ImageSearch
This app uses the Pixabay API to search for and return images. 
The app requires an API key to work. It is really easy to get one, and it will only take a couple of minutes.

After the repository is cloned, a gradle.properties file needs to created in the Android Studio project folder when 
in project view. Alternatively you could add a gradle.properties file in the Gradle.Scripts folder when in Android view.
It will need to contain one variable. API_KEY = "yourApiKeyHere" with API_KEY, written in this way. Then you should sync 
the project With Gradle.
